# Gridpack-based SMS production workflow 

## Structure

Folder `production` - will contain the MadGraph cards (or the scripts that generate them), fragments specifying the Pythia SLHA tables + any corresponding scripts - details to be determined once we settle on workflow.

Folder `test` - used to keep track of and share scripts, fragments for central production test workflows.
